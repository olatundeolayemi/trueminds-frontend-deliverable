🍽️ Chuks Kitchen – Food Ordering Web Interface

Trueminds Innovations Ltd – Frontend Developer Deliverable

 Project Overview

This project is a responsive frontend implementation of the Chuks Kitchen Food Ordering & Customer Management System.

The objective of this deliverable was to convert the provided Figma UI design into a functional and visually accurate webpage using clean, structured, and maintainable frontend code.

The webpage visually represents a food ordering platform where users can:

Browse available meals

View organized food sections

Interact with call-to-action buttons

Navigate through a structured layout

Experience a responsive design across different screen sizes

 This implementation is frontend-only.
There is no backend integration, authentication system, or API functionality as specified in the assignment guidelines.

 Assignment Goal

This project was completed to demonstrate:

Ability to translate UI/UX design into structured HTML & CSS

Attention to layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy

Code readability and maintainability

Basic responsiveness using modern CSS techniques

Clear technical documentation for future developers

🛠 Tech Stack Used

HTML5 – Semantic structure and content layout

CSS3 – Styling, layout, and responsiveness

Flexbox – Layout alignment and spacing

CSS Grid – Structured content sections

Media Queries – Responsive design adjustments

Figma – Design reference provided by the UI/UX team

Why These Technologies?

The assignment required clarity and structure rather than complexity.
Using core HTML and CSS ensures:

Clean and readable code

Strong layout fundamentals

Full control over responsiveness

No unnecessary over-engineering

 Design Interpretation

The Figma design was translated into code by:

Maintaining consistent spacing and alignment

Following the visual hierarchy of headings and sections

Structuring content into reusable layout blocks

Matching font sizing and layout proportions as closely as possible

Implementation Approach

Used semantic HTML elements:

<header>

<main>

<section>

<footer>

Used Flexbox for:

Navigation alignment

Card layouts

Horizontal spacing

Used CSS Grid where appropriate for structured layouts.

Assumptions Made

Some font styles were approximated if exact values were not specified

Minor spacing values were visually estimated

Interactive components are static (UI representation only)

📱 Responsiveness

The webpage was designed to adapt across different screen sizes.

Desktop

Multi-column layout

Structured sections

Clear spacing and alignment

Mobile

Stacked layout

Adjusted font sizes

Flexible containers

Maintained visual hierarchy

Responsive techniques used:

Flex-wrap

CSS Grid auto-fit

Media queries

Relative units (%, rem)

 Features Implemented

Responsive navigation bar

Hero section

Food listing cards

Structured content sections

Clear call-to-action buttons

Clean and organized layout

⚠ Limitations

No backend functionality

No authentication system

No real cart functionality

Static content only

Limited interactivity

 Future Improvements

If given more time, I would:

Add JavaScript for interactive cart functionality

Improve accessibility (ARIA roles and semantic improvements)

Optimize images for better performance

Add smooth UI animations

Refactor into reusable components using a framework like React
